# Qadence-ODE-Solver

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for optimizing hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization with the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm. The notebook demonstrates how to use the `hyperopt` library to efficiently search for optimal hyperparameters for a machine learning model.

## Introduction
In this project, we use the `hyperopt` library to perform hyperparameter optimization for a hypothetical machine learning model. The optimization process leverages the TPE algorithm, which is particularly effective in handling high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces.

## Installation
To run the notebook, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `hyperopt` library
- `numpy` library

You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install hyperopt
pip install numpy
